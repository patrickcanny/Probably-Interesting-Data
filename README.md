EECS 738 - Machine Learning Project 1 Code
Submission by: Patrick Canny and Liam Ormiston

### Background & Inspiration
For this project, we selected the Red Wind Characteristics dataset, along with the Mushroom dataset. 

For the Red Wine Dataset, we formulated the following ideas:
- Predict Wine Quality 
  - K-Means where K = 2 or 3 
- Categorize Wines
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Gaussian Mixture Models

For the Mushroom Dataset, we formulated the following ideas: 
- Predict if a mushroom is poisonous
  - K-Means K = 2
  - Gaussian Mixture Model
- Categorize by similarity
  - K-Means or Gaussian Mixture Model

We will also consider adding in expectation-maximization into our implementations.
